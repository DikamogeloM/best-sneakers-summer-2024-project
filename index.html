            <h3>WHY SNEAKERS</h3>
            <h2>Hip-Hop Iconic Sneakers History</h2>
            <p>
              Chris Gibbons, CEO of the sneaker marketplace Laced, says it all:
              “The popular sneakers we love today? They started as basketball
              shoes, adopted by hip-hop culture.” It makes sense, right? Fans
              wanted to rock the same gear as their idols, to feel part of their
              world. And that connection between athletes and musicians only
              grew stronger. These Hip-Hop iconic sneakers love affair is a
              two-way street.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the bond between hip-hop and sneakers goes deeper than just
              sporting the same kicks as your favourite ballplayer. It’s about
              what those sneakers represent: success, power, and that
              hard-earned come-up story.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nike’s Air Force 1 is a prime example. It’s a certified Hip-Hop
              iconic sneaker in its own right. These kicks became iconic thanks
              to rappers from New York, Philly, and other East Coast cities
              where the shoe represented a symbol for hustlers and street
              achievers. They weren’t about MJ dropping 50 points (although that
              would be impressive in any shoe), they were about everyday people
              making it big.
